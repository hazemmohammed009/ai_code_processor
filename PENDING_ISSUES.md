# Pending Issues and Next Steps

Thank you for providing the files. I have successfully converted the project from a single HTML file with vanilla JavaScript into a modern React application using Vite and TypeScript.

Here are the final steps you need to take to run the application and make it fully functional:

## 1. Running the Application

I have set up the project with all the necessary dependencies and configuration files. To run the application, follow these steps in your terminal:

1.  **Install Dependencies (if you haven't already):**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the Vite development server, and you can view the application in your browser at the URL provided (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

## 2. Providing API Keys

The application is now structured to make real API calls to AI models, but it requires valid API keys to do so.

-   Go to the **"إعدادات"** (Settings) tab in the application.
-   Enter your valid API key for each AI model you wish to use in the corresponding input field.
-   Click **"حفظ الإعدادات"** (Save Settings) to save your keys to the browser's local storage for the current session.

**Note:** The API keys are stored in your browser's local storage and are not sent anywhere else.

## 3. Implementing Real API Calls

The `callAIModel` function in `ai_code_processor_enhanced.tsx` is currently a **simulation**. It mimics the behavior of an API call but does not send any real data.

To make the application fully functional, you need to replace the simulated API call with a real one.

-   **Open the file `ai_code_processor_enhanced.tsx`**.
-   **Find the `callAIModel` function.**
-   **Replace the simulated code with your actual API call logic.**

Here is the part of the code that needs to be replaced:

```javascript
    // SIMULATED API CALL - REPLACE WITH REAL ONE
    await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1500 + Math.random() * 2000));

    const simulatedResponse = `// نتيجة محاكاة من ${model.name}
// المهمة: ${model.role}
// المشروع: ${context.type || 'غير محدد'}
// اللغة: ${context.language || 'غير محدد'}

function main() {
  console.log('تم إنشاء الكود بواسطة ${model.name}');
  // Prompt: ${prompt.substring(0, 100)}...
}

main();
`;
    updateModelStatus(model.id, 'success');
    return simulatedResponse;
```

You should replace this block with a `fetch` call to your desired AI provider's API endpoint (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Google AI), using the API key from the model's configuration.

Once these steps are completed, the application should be fully functional. If you have any other questions, feel free to ask!
